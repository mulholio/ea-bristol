# Effective Alturism Bristol

This is a small, informational site for the EA community in Bristol. You can find it at EABristol.com.

## Usage
- Start a development server with `yarn dev`
  - _Other scripts like `build`, [`format`](#automatic-code-formatting) and [`lint`](#linting) are also available_

## Making Changes
- This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). That means that all you have to do to update the site is push to master and your changes will be deployed automatically.
- If you want to update content, this site uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), a kind of Markdown that lets you write JSX too. For the most part, you can ignore this and just write normal markdown in the `content/` folder. Any new files in this folder will automatically generate a new component which can then be imported to a page. See `index.mdx` and `index.jsx` for an example.

- This project was started from [Gatsby Starter Modern](https://github.com/kripod/gatsby-starter-modern)

## Developer experience

### Automatic code formatting

[Prettier][] is an opinionated code formatter aiming to provide codebase consistency when multiple developers work on the same project. The main reason behind adopting Prettier is to [stop all the on-going debates over coding styles][].

- Styles are linted by [stylelint][], adhering to the rules specified in [stylelint-config-recommended][].
